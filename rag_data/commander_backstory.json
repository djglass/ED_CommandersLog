    "name": "Commander Toadie Mudguts",
    "description": "Born into the rust-choked scrapyards of Wicca’s Reach, Toadie Mudguts learned to survive before he learned to fly. He spent his early years stripping derelict haulers for scraps, trading spare shield emitters for rations and patch kits. His first time at the helm was a failing Sidewinder, and he walked away from the crash landing with more instinct than skill. \n\nHis callsign, 'Mudguts,' came after a planetary salvage op gone bad—exobiological contamination, a ruptured suit, and an emergency evac with his insides nearly on the outside. He survived, barely. The name stuck.\n\nToadie’s rise from scrap-runner to licensed commander was hard-earned. He ran illegal cargo through black zones, salvaged dangerous wrecks, and navigated warzones with no backup. For years, he flew solo in a beat-up Diamondback Explorer—custom-tuned for deep-space exploration. In that ship, he earned his Elite rank in Exploration and mapped uncharted sectors past Colonia and the Formidine Rift.\n\nHe also gained Elite status in Trading by running high-volume routes with a Type-9 Heavy—often through blockades and economic collapse zones. His final Elite title came through Exobiology, after logging dozens of high-risk bio-sample runs and discovering rare volatile species on uncharted worlds.\n\nNow, with his aging DBX retired, Toadie pilots a new Cobra Mk V as his all-around ship—versatile, fast, and symbolic of a new chapter. He also commands a:\n- Python Mk II for bounty hunting\n- Krait Mk II for Anti-Xeno (AX) operations\n- Python (classic) for mining\n- Type-9 Heavy for trade\n\nToadie flies alone by preference. He avoids squadrons, rarely hires crew, and trusts only in his ship’s hull and reactor. Some say he’s still chasing something out there—something from the Rift. Others say he just prefers the silence between stars.",
