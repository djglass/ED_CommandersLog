It is obvious that there is great appetite for breaching the latest frontier to establish new colonies, further expanding humanity\u2019s sphere of influence in our section of the galaxy.\u201dThe Trailblazer megaships are expected to be deployed in the coming weeks.Participants can now collect their rewards from the initiative.",

Analysts consider this a moment of historical significance, as viable colony targets will not be dictated by large corporations or superpower governments.CEO Madelyn Teague shared her enthusiasm at a gala event in Minerva, covered by Vox Galactica:\u201cThe sheer potential of this process is staggering. I\u2019m delighted that the move towards widespread, community-led expansion was so eagerly endorsed by all three superpowers. System colonisation contacts will be available on starports to facilitate the initial work on a claimed system.\u201d\u201cThis is an exciting time, and I can't wait to see how the next few months unfold. Particularly when the latest additions to Brewer Corporation\u2019s Trailblazer fleet are finished next week. That initiative is still ongoing at Starlace Station, by the way!\u201dThose looking to begin a new colony are advised to purchase and prepare a suitable transport vessel, as considerable resources are needed to establish a new port in a claimed system.",

Rennik\u2019s press release, published through most major news feeds, offered an update on Brewer\u2019s broader colonisation plans.An excerpt highlighted by Vox Galactica:\u201cA key feature of independent colonisation plans is the beacon and suite module used to establish a successful claim. Our secure manufacturing facilities across several systems have been producing considerable stocks of these devices ready to supply outfitters.\u201d\u201cThis morning, we held talks with representatives of minor factions on the fringes of populated space. It was suggested \u2013 and we agreed - that the initial colonisation efforts carried out with Brewer technology could benefit from mobile market support.\u201d\u201cI have therefore commissioned new additions to the Trailblazer megaship fleet, which will aid in supplying early colony claims. To ensure these megaships are ready for service and sufficiently stocked on time, we call for independent traders to bring specific commodities to Minerva so we can meet our planned two-week deadline.\u201dA number of commodities have been requested by Brewer Logistics, the logistical arm of Brewer Corporation, which are detailed within the initiative. Following a recent security incident, a secondary initiative to protect traders in the Minerva system is also underway, with contributions measured in bounty vouchers.",

The latest wave of survey data will be processed through a recently updated software algorithm for the next phase of preparation, in pursuit of a widespread expansion campaign. That campaign will be led by factions and communities across the core systems.\u201dInterest in the survey campaign has been met with enthusiasm by many displaced communities resulting by the Thargoid War, who see talk of a \u2018new frontier\u2019 as a chance at a fresh start.However, the initiative was briefly disrupted by lockdown within the system, initiated by a number of rogue Commanders. This has been perceived by many groups as an attempt to sabotage humanity's first expansion efforts in many years, although their motives remain unclear.Participants to the campaign can now collect their rewards from the Trailblazer Echo in HIP 90578.",

Brewer Corporation has proudly supported ambitious projects such as the Colonia Bridge, and worked with other corporations to improve and increase starports across the galaxy.

But, until today, it had given shareholders no sign that it would endorse widespread colonisation plans.Some media analysts have claimed that Brewer Corporation has been in significant talks with superpower lobbyists in recent weeks, which could explain the change of heart. The level of influence the superpowers had on this announcement is unconfirmed.Explorers who wish to contribute to the initiative can hand in exploration data to the Trailblazer Echo in the HIP 90578 system. Contributions will be valued by thoroughness, with full FSS scans and planetary probing completions rewarded higher.",

Shortly before detonation, the last remaining Thargoid vessels were seen entering portals to leave the system. No Thargoid ships remain in Sol.President Felicia Winters, speaking from Feynman in Eta Cassiopeiae, announced victory in the Battle for Sol via all newsfeeds:\u201cThis is a historic moment in human history. We have fought together against an alien invader who sought to dominate us. In this moment, today, we have triumphed. The heart of the Federation was the Thargoid\u2019s final target, and with Aegis\u2019 support the Federation stood firm. Now we look to rebuild, refocus and move forward.\u201dProfessor Alba Tesreau also provided a statement on behalf of Aegis:\u201cIt is important to recognise the significance of our victory. When coming together as one, working side-by-side regardless of identity or allegiance, we have proven that humanity can withstand significant challenges and move forward, arm in arm, towards the future. But in such moments, we remember those who have been taken from us \u2013 the selfless, the heroic and the loved. It will take time to heal. We thank the efforts of all those who defended us against the Thargoids, due to which so many of us remain to mourn the lost.\u201dWords of support from Allied and Imperial figures have been exchanged, though some Federal ICE-Casters have drawn attention to the lack of military support from the other superpowers during Cocijo\u2019s assault on Sol.The repair of all offline ports in Sol has been highlighted as the next priority. Shipments of materials needed to complete the restoration of these locations are needed in Sol and neighbouring systems which experienced Thargoid invasion.Refugees numbering in the billions remain homeless, still living in temporary shelters assigned by Rescue Megaship processing teams. Many of these refugees are reluctant to return to their home systems and are looking for new opportunities among the stars.Participants in the assault on Titan Cocijo can now collect their rewards from Rescue Ship Hutner in the Luyten\u2019s Star system.",
