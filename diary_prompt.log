It was awarded to pilots who provided data on worlds with ammonia-based atmospheres for its terraforming programme.\n\nSinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation, provided details:\n\n\u201cFollowing a feasibility study, we have determined that this module can be economically mass produced for general sale. Our fully engineered detailed surface scanner has twice probe coverage, allowing planets and moons to be mapped more efficiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to begin production, we require large quantities of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents. We will generously reward pilots who can deliver these to Ashby City in the Luyten\u2019s Star system.\u201d\n\nThe Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 will be available for purchase at all human technology brokers, assuming that sufficient quantities of commodities can be obtained. (Capital: Unknown, Leader: Unknown)\nThargoid Research Project Phase One Completed: *Pilots\u2019 Federation ALERT*\n\nProfessor Ishmael Palin has received multiple shipments of Thargoid meta-alloys for xenological study.\n\nFrom Abel Laboratory, his workshop in the Arque system, Professor Palin made the following announcement:\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful to all those who collected meta-alloys from barnacle sites. Analysing these samples will help us learn more about the biomechanical technology currently employed by the Thargoid fleets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am planning the second phase of this project, which has the combined assistance of the Alliance, Empire and Federation. Despite the horror of the recent attacks, we must seize every chance to increase our scientific knowledge.\u201d\n\nProfessor Palin has authorised payment for all pilots who took part in the initiative. This includes awarding class 4A, 5A and 6A corrosion resistant cargo racks to those who made the greatest contributions.\n\nThe rewards can be collected at the starport James Sneddon in the Morten-Marte system. In addition, the Federal Reclamation Co will continue to offer high prices for Thargoid tissue samples sold via the station\u2019s market. (Capital: Unknown, Leader: Unknown)\nEngineer\u2019s Enhanced Missile Rack Initiative: *Pilots Federation ALERT*\n\nThe engineer Liz Ryder has requested mined materials to help make a previously unique ship module widely available.\n\nThe module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was offered in October 3306 to pilots who helped defend the Eurybia system from Imperial forces. At the time, the Empire suspected Liz Ryder of supplying weapons to the NMLA terrorist group.\n\nMs Ryder has announced that her aim is to make this specially modified weapon available for purchase at all human technology brokers. She added:\n\n\u201cPilots can help kick-start this project by providing mined commodities, which will temporarily reduce the amount of materials that customers require to obtain the missile rack. As a bonus, the highest contributors to this initiative will be gifted with the module.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to be working with tech brokers to add this to the market. Many engineers think we could do more to serve the galactic community, and this is a step in that direction.\u201d\n\nShipments of bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium can be delivered to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system. (Capital: Unknown, Leader: Unknown)\nThargoid Research Project Requires Meta-Alloys: *Pilots\u2019 Federation ALERT*\n\nCommanders have been asked to collect meta-alloys from Thargoid barnacles as part of a wider xenological study.\n\nThe research project is being orchestrated by Professor Ishmael Palin, one of the most prominent experts in Thargoid technology:\n\n\u201cWith escalating Thargoid activity in the core systems, it is increasingly important that we learn as much as possible about this species. Only through scientific study can we better comprehend their biomechanical nature and, where possible, enhance our defences against it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe initial phase requires fresh samples of meta-alloys, the unique material used in the construction of Thargoid vessels. These can be harvested from barnacles that the Thargoids have seeded on selected planets.\u201d\n\nPilots can deliver meta-alloys to the starport James Sneddon in the Morten-Marte system. As part of the Federal Reclamation Co\u2019s support for this initiative, the station\u2019s market also offers an increased price for any Thargoid tissue samples.\n\nIn addition to credit payments for all those delivering meta-alloys, class 4A, 5A and 6A corrosion resistant cargo racks will be available to selected contributors. The 5A and 6A versions have been exclusively manufactured for this project, and are not commercially available at present.\n\nProfessor Palin stated that possessing these cargo racks will be of great benefit in the project\u2019s planned second phase, scheduled to occur in the next few weeks. (Capital: Unknown, Leader: Unknown)\nStation Construction Now Underway: Thanks to the combined efforts of entrepreneurs, small business owners and corporate sponsors, preparations for the launch of the new EAUC Exploration Ocellus are now well underway. 4871 commanders contributed over 8154177 tons of metal to the project, which in turn has allowed the EAUC coalition to outfit the station to a level far beyond their original specifications.\n\nUniversal Cartographics has released a statement thanking the committee members who wisely chose the mineral rich system of HIP 101110 as the potential launch site, as well as to Zimm_Macugz for organising the delivery of an impressive 150000 tonnes of raw materials.\n\nThe new station is expected to be ready for its maiden voyage to HIP 101110 now know as New Yembo within the next few days.
